Here's a brief overview of the core symptoms of Depressive Disorder:

Core Symptoms (Must experience at least one):

Depressed mood: This refers to feeling sad, empty, hopeless, or down most of the day, nearly every day. It can be subjective (reported by the person) or observed by others in their behavior.
Loss of interest or pleasure: This involves a significant decrease in interest or enjoyment in activities that were once pleasurable. It should be nearly all or all activities and occur most of the day, nearly every day.


Additional Symptoms (Need at least five during the same two-week period):

Significant weight loss/gain or appetite changes: This can include weight loss without dieting or weight gain of at least 5% of body weight in a month. There can also be a decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.
Sleep problems: This includes either insomnia (trouble sleeping) or hypersomnia (sleeping too much) nearly every day.
Psychomotor agitation or retardation: This refers to either restlessness or being slowed down in movement and speech. It must be observable by others, not just a feeling.
Fatigue or loss of energy: This involves feeling tired or lacking energy nearly every day, which can significantly impact daily life.
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt: This includes feeling worthless or excessively guilty nearly every day. The guilt may not be based on reality.
Diminished ability to think or concentrate: This can manifest as indecisiveness or difficulty focusing, occurring nearly every day.
Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide: This includes having thoughts of death (not necessarily about suicide) or recurrent suicidal ideation (thinking about suicide without a specific plan) or a suicide attempt or plan.
