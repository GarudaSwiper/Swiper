Here's a brief overview of the core symptoms of Bipolar disorder:

Elevated Mood: This can manifest as intense happiness, excitement, or euphoria.
Irritable Mood: For some people, the mood shift leans towards irritability and anger.
Increased Activity or Energy: This can include being unusually talkative, having racing thoughts, feeling restless, and engaging in more activities than usual.
Other Symptoms: Several other symptoms may be present, including inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, engaging in risky activities, and difficulty concentrating.

The DSM-5 also recognizes different specifiers for Bipolar I disorder, such as:

With Mixed Features: When symptoms of both mania/hypomania and depression occur simultaneously.
With Rapid Cycling: Experiencing four or more mood episodes (depressive, manic, or hypomanic) within a year.
Other Specifiers: These include factors like severity, psychotic features, and course of illness.
